<div> Oh, I see that you are at this page now. </div>
<div>	You have taken my advice.</div>
<div>	I haven't had anyone listen to my tips before.</div>
<div>	This makes me very excited.</div>
<div>	I am going to tell all my friends about this.</div>
<div>	That is if they decide to listen to me for once.</div>
<div>	But again, thank you for making my day.</div>

<p> The name is Lucia, and I'm here to say, I hope you enjoy this page and have a nice day.
But please don't leave, because I'll be displeased, I want you to know more about me.
You see that picture over there? That's me, you see. Oh wait it seemed to have disappeared
I apologize deeply. </p>

<p> Hey, you thought that was cool? I also did, it seems like we have that in common.
  What if we have even more in common than we thought? How about you check out the Things I Enjoy
  page and see what we might have in common. </p>

  <p>But enough of the self-advertising, let me continue this story about me. I am this pretty snazzy girl who doesn't have much to say,
    so I am sorry for taking your time. </p>

<div id="bottom"> This website is brought to you by Lucia, and we hope to Cia later. </div>
